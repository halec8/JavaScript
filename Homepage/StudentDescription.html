    A Little More About Me
</h1>
<p class ="secondParagraph">

    Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better! Again, my name is Cody Hale. I am married to my wonderful
    wife Shianna (25) and I have 3 kids named Aria (5), Liam (4), Harper (3). I have many passions.
    Firstly, knowing and growing in the truth of God's word. I believe that God sent his Son
    Christ to earth to die as a payment for our sin against God. I believe that Christ was resurrected on the 3rd
    day and then after His resurrection he ascended into Heaven to sit at the right hand of God the Father. I love to
    learn and really enjoy reading, listening to audio books/podcasts or watching educational video's. I also love arts
    and music. I play the drums, guitar, know some piano and love to sing even though i'm terible at it (Solely a
    shower singer). I enjoy drawing pictures of cartoons and anime however, I don't do that very often anymore.

    One of my biggest passions is competitive gaming. I really enjoy the League of Legends scene and the competitive
    scene within that community. I have played games since I was 4yrs old and on my free time like to compete in various
    online titles such as League of Legends, Overwatch or Call of Duty. I'm not professional and its solely just a
    time to relax on my down time but its still one of my favorite past times.
