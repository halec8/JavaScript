        <strong><em>Welcome!</em></strong> My name is Cody Hale and i'm a student a Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC).
        I am majoring in the Computer Information Systems and I'm in my second year of school. I work full time at Nationwide
        Insurance in the IT department as a Technology Services Practitioner Analyst. I have worked for Nationwide for the
        past 6 years which include Claims and IT. Prior to that I worked in the retail/service industry as a manager but after
        getting married I needed something more stable and focused on a long term, professional career. I love technology
        and I love the advancements we've made over the years of my lifespan. I remember when Windows 95 came out and
        computers were becoming more consumer friendly. I love building, thinking and analyzying problems and that's why I
        ultimately decided to get into an IT role as a stepping stone for Software Engineering/Development. In addition,
        that's the reason why I decided to go to college and get a degree. So again, Welcome! Feel free to use the navigation
        bar above to access my folders for homework projects. If you'd like to know a little more about me
